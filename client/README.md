Snap IT!
A review app made easy. Snap a picture, rate it.  That's it"
"A picture is worth a thousand words"!

Requirements:MERN stack used for front-end/UI,back-end and database design.  




Description:
  Users of my app will be able to search through a variety of community food reviews.
  Snap It! has two main categories:Professional and Amateur.
    -Professional Category (contains food reviews that are from Restaurants or Trained Chefs).  
    -Private Category(contains food reviews that are a more personal scope).
    Member Reviewers can then specify the type of cuisine, dish name, location, and the recipe(if Amateur), and the business location(if Professional). Lastly, all members give their member-approved ratings,and finish with a Snap.
    -Although, only members can upload photos and provide a approved rating, all user's can search and provide a community review.
